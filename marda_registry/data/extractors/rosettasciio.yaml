    The Rosetta Scientific Input Output library aims at providing easy reading and
    writing capabilities in Python for a wide range of scientific data formats. Thus
    providing an entry point to the wide ecosystem of python packages for scientific
    data analysis and computation, as well as an interoperability between different
    file formats. Just as the Rosetta stone provided a translation between ancient
    Egyptian hieroglyphs and ancient Greek. The RosettaSciIO library originates from
    the HyperSpy project for multi-dimensional data analysis. As HyperSpy is rooted
    in the electron microscopy community, data formats used by this community are
    still particularly well represented.
